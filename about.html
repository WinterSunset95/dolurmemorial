		<h2>Introduction: </h2>
		<p>
			Churachandpur, a small town located in the Southern part of Manipur was in darkness till 30th November, 1964 when a group of scholars and a few intellectuals led by Pu (L) Pauneikhai Vaiphei and (L) Dr. Pu TS Gangte met and discussed the possibility and the need for establishing a College. Members present in the meeting constituted the Governing Body, and (L) Pu Pauneikhai Vaiphei, chairing the meeting and (L) Dr. TS Gangte recording Secretary of the meeting were appointed as Chairman and Secretary of the upcoming College respectively. The College was then formally inaugurated on 30th November, 1964. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The College was started with some 100 students and a few dedicated teachers. The College, now is marching ahead each year producing more and more promising students who eventually became IAS, IPS, IDAS, IRS, etc. Officers serving the nation with dedication. By now, in 2020, the College produces the best kinds of students even topping the University to be more specific, in 2020, a midst large-scale pandemic, the College still has produced 4 (four) toppers, more than 80 (eighty) First Divisioners and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The College, now with a new team of well qualified teacher who work with a high sense of sincerity and dedication, becomes one of the finest College in Manipur, and it is our hope and aspiration that, as we move forward in all directions (academic, infrastructure, etc.) Churachandpur College would in a very near future become the finest College, not only in Manipur, bu also in entire North-East region. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The dynamic shifts and transforming course of life has also prompted us to consider and evolve on the various aspects of the college to ensure outstanding results in all fields. Focus on qualitative results has been a dominant feature of our curriculum. The infrastructure of the college has been restructured to keep up with advancements in academia on the national and global front. The college has introduced NSS, NCC, Mentor-Mentee Guidance, along with various committees to look after varied aspects of the college thoroughly. The IQAC has been the torch bearer guiding the college consistently to improve performances by evaluating and reflection upon the functioning of the various departments and committees. Interactions in the college in relation to committees meetings, departmental meetings, student-teachers interaction are thorough, exhaustive and forthright.
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe it is our duty to persist and persevere in renewing and revitalizing our model of education to go from strength to strength and stay true to our motto, ‘Clarion-E- Tenebris’ meaning ‘From Darkness to Light’.
